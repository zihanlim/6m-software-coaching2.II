Sample exercises:
1. Create a function that determines if a number is odd or even
    ex. checkOddEven(8) -> Even
    ex2. checkOddEven(99) -> Odd
2. Create a function that gets a number and checks if it is divisible by 3 or 5 or both
    ex. checkDiv(9) -> divisible by 3
    ex2. checkDiv(10) -> divisible by 5
    ex3. checkDiv(15) -> divisible by 3 and 5
    ex4. checkDiv(11) -> not divisible by 3 nor 5
3. Create a function called printFizzBuzz that gets a number and prints in the following format:
    ex. printFizzBuzz(15)
    1 - pop
    2 - fizz
    3 - buzz
    4 - fizz
    5 - pop
    6 - fizzbuzz
    ....
    11 - pop
    12 - fizzbuzz
    13 - pop
    14 - fizz
    15 - buzz

Challenge 1: Create a function that checks if a year is a leap year or not
